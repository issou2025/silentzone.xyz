            <h3 class="faq-question">What is the difference between noise cancelling and noise isolating headphones?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Noise cancelling headphones use active electronic circuitry to reduce ambient noise by creating sound waves that are opposite to the unwanted noise. Noise isolating headphones, on the other hand, use physical barriers like foam ear tips or over-ear cups to block sound from entering your ears.</p>
              <p>Active noise cancellation is particularly effective against low-frequency, constant sounds like airplane engines or air conditioning, while passive noise isolation works well across all frequencies.</p>

            <h3 class="faq-question">How effective is soundproofing foam?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Soundproofing foam is effective for reducing echo and improving acoustics within a room, but it's not very effective at blocking sound from entering or leaving a room. This is because foam primarily absorbs sound waves rather than blocking them.</p>
              <p>For true soundproofing, you need mass and density. Consider using materials like mass-loaded vinyl, acoustic panels with backing, or adding extra drywall layers.</p>

            <h3 class="faq-question">What is the best way to soundproof an apartment?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The best apartment soundproofing methods include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Adding mass to walls:</strong> Use temporary solutions like acoustic panels or tapestries</li>
                <li><strong>Sealing gaps:</strong> Use weatherstripping around doors and windows</li>
                <li><strong>Soundproof curtains:</strong> Heavy, thick curtains can reduce noise significantly</li>
                <li><strong>Floor coverings:</strong> Rugs and carpeting reduce impact noise</li>
                <li><strong>White noise machines:</strong> Mask unwanted sounds with consistent background noise</li>
              </ul>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">Do white noise machines actually work?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes, white noise machines are effective at masking unwanted sounds by providing consistent background noise. They work by creating a sound that covers the frequency range of human hearing, making other sounds less noticeable.</p>
              <p>They're particularly helpful for sleep, concentration, and privacy. Different types of noise (white, pink, brown) work better for different situations and personal preferences.</p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">How much should I spend on noise-cancelling headphones?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Quality noise-cancelling headphones typically range from $100 to $400. The sweet spot for most users is $200-300, where you'll find excellent noise cancellation, good sound quality, and comfortable designs.</p>
              <p>Budget options ($50-100) can provide basic noise reduction, while premium models ($300+) offer the best technology and build quality. Consider your specific needs and usage patterns when making a decision.</p>

            <h3 class="faq-question">Can I soundproof my home office for video calls?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes, you can significantly improve your home office acoustics for video calls:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Acoustic panels:</strong> Place on walls behind and around your desk</li>
                <li><strong>Soft furnishings:</strong> Add rugs, curtains, and upholstered furniture</li>
                <li><strong>Microphone placement:</strong> Use a quality microphone close to your mouth</li>
                <li><strong>Background noise:</strong> Minimize with weatherstripping and door seals</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">What's the difference between white, pink, and brown noise?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p><strong>White noise:</strong> Contains all frequencies at equal intensity, sounds like static or a fan</p>
              <p><strong>Pink noise:</strong> Emphasizes lower frequencies, sounds like rainfall or ocean waves</p>
              <p><strong>Brown noise:</strong> Even more emphasis on low frequencies, sounds like a deep rumble or thunder</p>
              <p>Pink noise is often preferred for sleep, while white noise is good for concentration. Brown noise can be very relaxing for some people.</p>
